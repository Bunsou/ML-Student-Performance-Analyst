This is a project given by my Machine Learning professor. The goal is to use machine learning to solve problem or issue in Cambodia.
In my project, I am trying to use machine learning make an anlysis on KIT Student Performance using Student Performance Data Set in the first year of university. The students' identities are confidential, so there is no way to identify whose data is this (all data ids are randomized). I hope this project will be interesting for you and would provide a interesting insight for the students' performance in the first year of university.

Here's the Problem Statement of the project:

# Problem Statement

In KIT, students academic performances are in consistent across different subjects, between core subjects and soft subjects and between practical-based subjects and theory-based subjects. This inconsistency raises concerns about the factors influencing student performance and how they can be addressed.

This project aims to analyze student performance patterns based on study subjects, subject type and nature of learning. The insights will help educators and students optimize study strategies for better academic outcomes.
