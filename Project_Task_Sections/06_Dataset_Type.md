## Dataset Type

**Primary Dataset**

I am using the provided students performance score in the first year. All the data are anonymized and do not contain any personal information. I also made some surveys to get some more additional information for the analysis. The dataset contains the following columns:

- 'ID'
- 'Subject' : name of subject
- 'Score' : score of the student in the subject
- 'Semester' : semester in which the subject is taught
- 'Type of Subject' : type of subject (core, soft)
- 'Nature of Subject' : Practical or Theory
