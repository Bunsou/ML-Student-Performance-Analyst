## Dataset

I've used all the data to build the dataset into a single CSV file.

- If you want to check the how data is made, please go back to main directory (`KIT_Student_Performance_Analysis_Project`) and check the `making_dataset.ipynb` file.
- If you want to check the dataset, please go back to main directory (`KIT_Student_Performance_Analysis_Project`) and check the `data` folder. In this folder you will see 2 file (one is the xlsx file and the other is the csv file). The xlsx file is the original file and the csv file is the one I used to build the dataset. In short, the csv file is the final dataset that I used for analysis.
