## Problem Statement

In KIT, students academic performances are in consistent across different subjects, between core subjects and soft subjects and between practical-based subjects and theory-based subjects. This inconsistency raises concerns about the factors influencing student performance and how they can be addressed.

This project aims to analyze student performance patterns based on study subjects, subject type and nature of learning. The insights will help educators and students optimize study strategies for better academic outcomes.
