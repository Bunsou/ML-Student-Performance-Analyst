## Accuracy Results and Model Performance

#### Model Comparison Results

After training all four regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regression), their performance was compared. The models were ranked primarily based on their Test R² scores, as this metric indicates how well they explain the variance in student scores on unseen data. The ranking revealed distinct performance differences among the algorithms.

#### Performance Interpretation

A clear classification system was established to interpret the model's R² score:

- Excellent: R² > 0.8 (Model explains over 80% of the variance in scores)
- Good: R² > 0.6 (Model explains between 60% and 80% of the variance)
- Fair: R² > 0.4 (Model explains between 40% and 60% of the variance)
- Poor: R² ≤ 0.4 (Model explains less than 40% of the variance)

#### Evaluation Methodology

The overall evaluation process encompassed a comprehensive approach:

- Quantitative Assessment: Utilizing the R², MAE, and RMSE metrics to provide a numerical measure of accuracy and error.
- Visual Analysis: Creating scatter plots of actual versus predicted values, along with residual plots, to visually identify any patterns in prediction errors or outliers.
- Comparative Analysis: Performing a side-by-side comparison of all implemented models to objectively determine the optimal performer based on their predictive capabilities.

The final selection of the "best model" was automatically driven by the highest achieved Test R² score, ensuring an objective choice based on the model's demonstrated predictive power.
