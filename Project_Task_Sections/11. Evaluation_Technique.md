## Evaluation Techniques and Formulas

#### Evaluation Metrics Implementation

To assess the performance of each trained model, three primary evaluation metrics were utilized:

- RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

#### Validation Approach

To ensure that the selected model can generalize well to new, unseen data, an 80-20 train-test split was used.

- The training set (80%) was used to train (fit) the models, allowing them to learn the underlying patterns.
- The test set (20%) was held out and used exclusively for unbiased evaluation of the trained models' performance on data they had never seen during training.
